I installed Selenium library and Chrome driver 
that suits for my browser on my machine.

Using this library classes I created instance of a WebDriver class.
Then I used its get method to reach the Playtech web page.
Then using Chrome extension SelectorsHub managed to find Internship tab by cssSelector 
and then using pageSource method verified that Internship is not there and wrote it into file "result.txt"
